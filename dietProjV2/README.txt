At BRANDNAME, we are dedicated to providing optimal nutrition for EVERYONE. 
Whether you are looking to lose weight, maintain, or you are just too busy to sit down and eat, we've got you covered!

Each BRANDNAME plan provides a full day's worth of food with a focus on quality, plant-based protein to keep you powered up throughout your day.

BRANDNAME plans can be used short-term (typically 7 - 10 days) to kick-start weight loss or instill healthier eating habits,
or they can be used longer term for on-the-go individuals who simply find it difficult to prepare meals or find time to eat.

Use our tools below to start your BRANDNAME journey.

This console app features an interactive menu with options to view plans, view flavors, and to get matched with a diet plan based upon user input.
Additionally, if the user chooses weight loss as their goal, it will lead them to an optional method to calculate how long it will take them to get to their goal weight based on user input.


My 3 chosen features:

1) Master loop which guides user through the entire program.

2) Conversion tools: There are 2 conversions inbedded into the first calculator: lbs to kg and in to cm. 
   The calculator itself takes multiple kinds of user input to get the user's estimated daily calorie expenditure. 
   Additionally, the second calculator converts pounds to calories -- 1 pound is equal
   to 3,500 calories -- in order to output a number of days based upon user input.

3) Countdown clock: I use DateTime to count down to the release of a new flavor within my DisplayFlavors method in the DietObj class.
